        Read an integer N. This N will be the number of integer numbers X that will be read.

        Print how many these numbers X are in the interval [10,20] and how many values are out of
        this interval.

        Input
        The first line of input is an integer N (N < 10000), that indicates the total number of
        test cases. Each case is an integer number X (-107 < X < 107).

        Output
        For each test case, print how many numbers are in and how many values are out of the interval.
