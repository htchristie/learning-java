        Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show:
        a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C.
        b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159)
        c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height.
        d) the area of the square that has side B.
        e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.

        Input
        The input file contains three double values with one digit after the decimal point.

        Output
        The output file must contain 5 lines of data. Each line corresponds to one of the areas
        described above, always with a corresponding message (in Portuguese) and one space between
        the two points and the value. The value calculated must be presented with 3 digits after
        the decimal point.
